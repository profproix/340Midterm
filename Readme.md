# 340 Midterm Deliverables

## What’s Already There

- Do not change anything in the index.html or CSS.
- Most of your code will go in index.js. Do not change anything in the logic.js file.
- Do not manually modify the existing reviews array. However, you may add new reviews to the array using JavaScript.
- The images folder contains images for the midterm. Feel free to add your own images.
- The code for your test will go in the test/test.js
- The package.json is already initialized, the only thing you’ll need to install your node modules with `npm i`

## Hints

- Manually test your code early and often.
- Don't forget to use debugger and console.log to debug your code.
- This is an open-book and open-internet exam, but you are not allowed to use AI tools.
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help. I can’t give you the answers, but I can nudge you in the right direction.
- Turning in something is better than turning in nothing.
- Check the rubric for exact details on what I’m looking for.

## Description

You will be making a Yelp-like application where users can leave reviews for a restaurant. Below are the deliverables you need to complete:

Render content to the DOM
Use a higher-order function
Extract data from a form
Write Mocha tests
This assignment covers content from Weeks 1-3.

What This Does Not Include
This assignment does not cover Week 4. You will not be required to:

Use Express
Work with REST or HTTP
Create an API

## Midterm Deliverables

1. Create a function that will render a review.

- The structure of the review should follow the example below.
- Pay attention to the class names, as they are important for CSS styling to be applied correctly.

  ```
  <div class="review_container">
    <img src="img url here"/>
    <div>
      <p> username here </p>
      <p> star rating here </p>
      <p> review here </p>
    <div>
  </div>

  ```

- Use .forEach to iterate through the reviews.
- Pass a callback to .forEach that renders each review.

2. JavaScript Forms

- Select the form from the DOM.
- Add an event listener to the form for the submit event.
- Don't forget e.preventDefault()
- On submit, the form should render a new review to the screen and add it to the existing reviews array.

3. Mocha Tests

- Create at minimum two test for the calculateStarAverage function in test/test.js
- Remember to import chai and the calculateStarAverage function
- Use npm run test to run your tests
